# ü´Ä Heart Disease Predictor using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project is a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on real medical attributes. It uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to make predictions from a dataset collected from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.

## üöÄ Features

- üß† Built with Scikit-Learn‚Äôs `KNeighborsClassifier`
- üìä Uses real-world data (`processed.cleveland.data`) from UCI
- üî¢ Takes user input from the console
- üìà Predicts heart disease presence based on 13 medical factors
- üí¨ Human-readable results ("You might have heart disease" or "You're good!")

## Why K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)?

KNN is a simple, yet powerful machine learning algorithm that works by:
- Looking at the 'k' closest data points (neighbors) to a new input.
- Voting based on their labels (in our case, whether they had heart disease or not).
- Predicting the majority class.

### Why KNN for this project?
- ‚úÖ Works well with small- to medium-sized datasets
- ‚úÖ No assumptions about data distribution (unlike logistic regression, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Easy to explain to non-ML folks
- ‚úÖ It‚Äôs non-parametric ‚Äî meaning it adapts to the actual data pattern
- ‚úÖ Can improve with data scaling (which we did with StandardScaler)

üí° We used k=5, a common starting point, to balance bias and variance.
